            Now, to explain what I've learned through my time here... Boy oh boy, where do I begin? First of all, FOCUS! Focus and dicipline are two of the most important things I've realized are key to software development. I have been working on my focus and study habits to stay on top of the fire hose of information blasting into my brain over the last few months. It is challenging and hard. One of my mottos in life is "Hard things make you Great!". The only problem is my other motto... "The harder you play, the younger you stay!" So, balancing "fun" and "hard mental work" can be difficult. Another thing I've realized is that I need to allow myself the grace to fail and receive the feedback that comes with it. I get behind and feel embarrassed to admit that I don't know what I'm doing, so I hold back and get frustrated and lost. Then I get so far behind that I get overwhelmed and don't know where to start. These things have been teaching me a lot about myself and what I need to do to find the success that I long for. One thing I do love are my "Ah ha!" moments. They are extremely rewarding when things finally Click! Piece by piece it keeps nudging me onward.

            My Favorite Coding Language...
            All of the different languages have their pros and cons for now. I am a very visual learner so that makes the easy ones like HTML and CSS my favorite for now because I can see immediate results and they are easy to figure out and rewarding to work with. I know that once I understand React it will be my favorite. I'm intrigued in discovering how all the moving components and peices unveil the magic of the INTERWEB!
